# Quantitive_Risk_Analysis_Project
Quantitive Risk Analysis of introduction of E. multilocularis into the uk using R

The model equation is

p(t) = (β(1 − e^(μ+β)t))/ (β + μ)

where p(t) is the probability a dog becomes infected during t weeks of holiday, β is the
infection pressure in France (weeks) and μ is the recovery rate (weeks). The value of
μ has been reported as 0.078 and the value of β is uncertain, with data suggesting a
range of 0.00001 to 0.0006 and a most likely value of 0.000187.
